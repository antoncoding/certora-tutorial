# Certora Tutorials 

## Hello and welcome to Certora's beginner's course!

</br>

This course is designed to get you started with Certora's Software as a Service called [**Certora Prover**](https://www.certora.com/#About).

The Certora Prover is a tool with an underlying technology based on 30 years of research in Formal Verification. It allows checking at compile-time whether all executions of a Smart Contract are fulfilling a set of pre-defined specifications. At the moment, the Certora Prover can run verifications on ***any computer program that can be compiled using EVM***.

The course will teach you how to think about system properties through a "rule writer"'s goggles, write specifications in Certora's spec language, and use the Certora Prover technology to verify your specifications or find bugs. We will guide you through the many features of the Certora Prover, basic workflow for approaching a verification job, and best practices that the Certora team has developed.

During the course, you will read articles and documentations, watch videos, and witness examples of real-life systems. All of these will be associated with the Ethereum blockchain and framework. The contracts are written in Solidity.

## Prerequisites

</br>

The course caters to absolute beginners in Formal Verification. However, we do assume a certain level of proficiency in some areas:

- A basic understanding of the Ethereum framework (events, gas, msg. , block. , etc.) and the Solidity language (the ability to read code is more important than writing).

- Familiarity with some basic and standard protocol contracts such as ERC20.

- We will use propositional logic to express rules and invariants about the systems we verify. Therefore, we expect basic familiarity with logic - signs, terms, and definitions.
