Property: For both token0 and token1 the balance of the system is at least as much as the reserves.

This property is implemented as an invariant. 
Invariants are a specification of a condition that should always be true once an operation is concluded.
In addition, the invariant also checks that it holds right after the constructor of the code runs.

This invariant also catches the bug 
Formula:
    getReserve0() <= _token0.balanceOf(currentContract) &&
    getReserve1() <= _token1.balanceOf(currentContract)
